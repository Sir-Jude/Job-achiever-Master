With my experience in dealing with software and computers along with my skills, I believe I will be a strong addition to your team.\n\nI completed a Master's degree in Finance and Payroll from Harvard University, where I developed critical thinking skills, attention to detail, and determination to learn. As a Payroll Manager at KWS GmbH, I used tools such as Excel, and the computer was my everyday companion to manage payments.\n\nWith proficiency in English, native Italian, and Romanian, I can also be the perfect fit to communicate with different stakeholders.\n\nAs someone that enjoys coding and playing with the computer, I can say that being a Junior Software Developer | Python would be a dream come true. Developing Microservices, Serverless Applications, and ETL processes for your Analysts and departments would enhance my skills, and I will flourish professionally.\n\nThank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJude Smiley"
