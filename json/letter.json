As a highly reliable and detail-oriented professional, I believe that I have the skills and experience necessary to excel in this role.\n\nWith a Master's degree in Finance and Payroll from Harvard University, I have gained valuable experience working as a Payroll Manager at KWS GmbH. In this role, I used Excel and several software programs every day to handle the payment process, which has significantly enhanced my computer skills. Moreover, my strong critical thinking and willingness to learn have enabled me to take on new challenges while remaining determined to deliver high-quality results.\n\nAs a native Italian speaker and fluent in English and Romanian, I would be able to work effectively in an international setting. Additionally, I am excited about playing with computers and coding, which are an integral part of this role.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications with you.\n\nSincerely,\nJude Smiley"
